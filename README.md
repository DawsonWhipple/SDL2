I wanted to learn the SDL2 graphics library for C++
This is a backup of my progress
In order to compile and run current version:
1.) Run MakeFile using this command "mingw32-make -f MakeFile"
2.) Run Main.exe

to run legacy versions whil still in the current branch then change the MakeFile for "src/main.cpp" to the desired version file, e.g. "src/drawPixel.cpp
